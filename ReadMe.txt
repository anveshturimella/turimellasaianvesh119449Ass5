1. Took few segment points.
2. Sorted given segment points by using bubble sort.
3. Find determinent af any two line segments.
4. Considered two sample line formates ax1+by1 = c1 and ax2+by2 = c2.
5. Calculated slopes and intersepts for each line.
6. if slopes of each line segment are equal then line segments do not intersect otherwise intersect.
